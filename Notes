This is the second Milestone Project from the Udemy Python course.
The goal is to create a (simplified) blackjack game.
Not interested in cards, have never played blackjack, don't know
anything about it so that is not very helpful.

The idea is to use OOP for this programme.

There will only be a computer as dealer, and a human player.

The normal deck of cards will be used so a representation of this
will have to be created in Python.

The human player has an attribute (bankroll) from which he can place
a bet.

The player starts with two cards face up; the computer dealer
starts with one card face up, one card face down.

The player goes first. Player goal: get closer to value of 21 than the computer dealer does.
Actions:
  1) HIT = receive another card from the deck
  2) STAY = stop receiving cards
Other blackjack actions are ignored.
